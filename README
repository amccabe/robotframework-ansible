A Robot Framework keyword library for the popular Ansible configuration and 
orchestration tool.

The example test suite (examples/example.tsv) runs the ping module with local 
transport using a hosts file containing a single entry for localhost 
(examples/hosts).

To run the example, make sure you have installed Robot Framework and run 
"pybot ./examples/example.tsv" from your checkout of this repository.  You can
see the results of the test by opening the results.html file that is created in
the browser of your choice.
